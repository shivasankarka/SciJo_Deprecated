# SciJo: Scientific Computing in Mojo

<img src="extras/SciJo.jpeg" alt="logo" width="250"/>

I started building this library as a general purpose replacement for NumPy, SciPy, ScikitHEP libraries in python. Recently I found another group working on a similar project called [NuMojo](https://github.com/Mojo-Numerics-and-Algorithms-group/NuMojo), therefore I have joined that group and will continue working on that project to build a general purpose replacement of NumPy, SciPy in Mojo. Meanwhile I will continue working on a replacement for Scikit-HEP, for which you can find the repository [here](). I will try to port as much as of the Scikit-HEP options natively to Mojo. 

I learnt a lot about low level programming, memory management etc through this project and I am thankful for that experience. This respository can be used as a reference for anyone trying to learn Mojo as it has used a lot of concepts in Mojo. Happy Coding!

## Features
For a full list of features currently implemented, please check [Available features](Features.md) for a list of function and properties implemented. 

## Installation

Clone the repository and build the mojo package (Currently not all functions are documented and therefore "mojo package" gives errors, I will resolve this soon. Please download and import it as module for now)
